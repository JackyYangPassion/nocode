# No Code

No code is the best way to write secure and reliable apps. Write nothing; deploy nowhere.
And I will put some usefull app package here ~ (By whoami)

## Getting Started

Start by not writing any code.

```markdown
1. Android ADB Tools -- 2018.06.10
```

The possibilities are endless.

### Building App

Now that you have not done anything it's time to build your application:

```markdown
1. Add some slides -- 2020.03.12
```

### Deploying

While you still have not done anything it's time to deploy your application. By running the following command you can deploy your application absolutely nowhere.

```dockerfile
# QA
Dockerfile is the best way to package app?
```

I know right?
